Moodle Wimba

this Repo has a branch for each Wimba Plugin.

as wimba has a number of mods and blocks but we would not be editing these plugins ours self it would seem an over kill to have each plugin in its own repo.

Code management policy states that all plugins should be version controlled and as Wimba do not or have not given access to
a git repository We have put the plugins into here
